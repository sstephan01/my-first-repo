# Hello Markdown!

It is **Sooo** nice to ve able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it* you just:

* Remember the basic syntax
* write your doc
* Done!

Now you can be a Wiz at this language and code up stuff like 'console.writeline("Hello Markdown!");'

Can't remember the language? No problem! Just visit one of these resources:
